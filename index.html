  <p>Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved — and more happy families created.</p>
  <p> According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year.</p>
  <p>The button below will take you to Kaggle for this specific competition.</p>

<p>PetFinder.my has been Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, 
	with a database of more than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, 
	corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.

<br>
<br>
<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is predicting the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the pet’s listing on PetFinder website. 
Sometimes a profile contains a group of pets. 
In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted.</p>

<br>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Python 3.6 and package such pandas, NumPy were used to process and analyze the raw data files. Package seaborn, 
	matplotlib, and plotly were used for visualization. Python packages tensorflow, sklearn, xgboost, 
	lightgbm were used for machine leaning algorithms. Exploratory Data Analysis provided the deep insights gained from 
	the dataset by visualizing. New features were conducted by feature engineering in order to be better prepared for modeling. 
	Modeling was done using XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and Back Propagation Neural Network. Lastly, conclusions 
	and recommendations were drawn based on the results of all processes in the project.</p>
